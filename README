Persona Placeholder
====================

Public templates of various flavors for creating personas.  Currently only an iWork Pages template exists.  Contributions welcome.


iWork Pages Template
--------------------

Drop it in your home folder in Library/Application Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My Templates/ and it will appear in the My Templates pane of the Template Chooser.

See http://timshadel.com/2009/01/05/craft-personas-with-a-template/ for more ideas and usage information.
